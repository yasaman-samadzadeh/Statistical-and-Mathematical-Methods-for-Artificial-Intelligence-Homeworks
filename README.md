# Statistical and Mathematical Methods for AI

This repository contains the homework assignments for the “Statistical and Mathematical Methods for AI” course at the University of Bologna. Each homework is focused on a different area of foundational mathematics and statistics for artificial intelligence applications.

## Contents

1. **Linear Algebra and Floating-Point Arithmetic**  
   Explore the basics of linear algebra with a focus on numerical stability and the implications of floating-point computations.

2. **SVD and PCA for Machine Learning**  
   Dive into singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA), fundamental techniques for dimensionality reduction and data analysis.

3. **Optimization**  
   Practice gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent to understand how optimization algorithms are implemented in machine learning.

4. **Parameter Estimation**  
   Learn about Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) methods for determining parameters in probabilistic models.
